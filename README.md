# MuseAI
Lyrics and Chord generation system

 In 2023, the music streaming industry was bustling with activity. A total of 606 mu
sic streaming businesses had been registered in the US in 2023 and there are 20+ AI
 music generator tools and 10+ Lyrics generator AI tools available online today which is
 a testament to the growing demand for convenient access to music across various plat
forms. However, despite this proliferation, a significant gap remained: most major music
 generator AI’s generate good music with no focus on lyrics and mood and the lyrics
 generators with not much focus on music, which is a major lapse in AI music generators
 available online. While AI can generate lyrics, it struggles to infuse them with genuine
 emotion or personal experiences. Authenticity and—the raw vulnerability that connects
 with listeners—is often missing.
 
 MuseAI, an AI software web-based platform built to explore the intersection of AI and
 music, harnessing the power of LLMs to classify music into genres or moods and gen
erate chord progressions that match given situational prompts. This initiative aims to
 democratize music composition, offering musicians, composers, and enthusiasts new tools
 to inspire creativity and innovation. By understanding and generating musical elements,
 the project showcases the potential of AI to complement human creativity, offering a new
 lens through which to explore the emotional and expressive capacities of music.
